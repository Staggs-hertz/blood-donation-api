# Blood Donation API

An open-source REST API for managing blood donation data and blood type compatibility.

## Purpose
This project aims to provide a reusable, transparent API that helps developers,
NGOs, and health platforms reason about blood donation and transfusion compatibility.

## Scope
- Blood group definitions (ABO + Rh)
- Compatibility rules
- Donor and donation records (non-sensitive data only)

> This API does NOT replace medical professionals. It is a decision-support tool only.
